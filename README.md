👋 Welcome to My Python Playground! 🐍
This repository is my little corner of the internet, where I document my coding journey, from beginner exercises to mini-projects and class assignments.
You will find bits of everything here: experiments, mistakes that taught me lessons, and code I am proud of. 🚀
It is basically my digital notebook of Python adventures, learning, testing, breaking things (on purpose sometimes 😅), and building them back better!
